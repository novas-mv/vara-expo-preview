   VARA Expo 2026 — section line sets

   Dynamic ribbon shapes as graphic elements: the same family of long, round-
   capped, generously curved strokes the landing page uses, but a CHEAP version
   — hand-authored beziers instead of the 23KB traced model spines, flat brand
   hues instead of 36-stop model gradients, and a LIBRARY of distinct shapes so
   no section repeats another section's line.

   Three earlier attempts were each wrong differently:
     1. generic beziers at 2.4px / .5 opacity — faint wallpaper, not graphics.
     2. the real traced spines with full model gradients — right weight, but
        576 gradient nodes per page and far more machinery than a subpage needs.
     3. the traced spines flattened — cheap enough, but only four shapes, so
        every section drew the same line again.
   This is the synthesis: many shapes, flat colour, big and confident.

   Construction follows ILLUSTRATION.md: round caps and joins, generous radii,
   open ends that bleed off the frame, no sharp corners, and the over-under
   weave via a casing painted in the page ground.

   Usage: `data-lines` on any section. Optional `data-lines="3"` pins a set.

   MOTION (DESIGN-SYSTEM.md 6): one hero stroke leads, the rest answer near-
   unison, expo-out because the value is SCRUBBED by scroll, complete by ~60%
   of the window then holds, plus a slow parallax drift.

   PERF: one shared rAF, transform + stroke-dashoffset only, off-screen
   sections culled, loop stops when scrolling settles and on visibilitychange.

     Stroke weights are the approved BOLD set (hero ~58px rendered at 1440) —
     the ribbons read as tubes, matching how the element is shown in the brand
     guideline, rather than as drawn lines.
     Rank 0 is the hero of the set. Sizes stay <=96vw ON PURPOSE: anything
     wider makes the document wider than the screen, which then needs an
     overflow clip somewhere, and every place to put that clip either chops the
     ribbons at a section seam or kills vertical scrolling. The paths already
     run from -60 to 1060 inside their own 1000-unit viewBox, so they still
     bleed off their box without overflowing the page.
     No shape repeats inside a set, and no two sets share a hero shape — that
     repetition is exactly what read as "the same line over and over". */
  /* [shape, hue, sizeVW, side, yPct, rotDeg, strokePx, alpha, parallax]

     COMPLETE FORMS, NOT CROPPED ONES. These used to be enormous ribbons
     anchored in a gutter with most of the shape off-frame, so what you saw was
     a fragment chopped by the viewport edge — an abrupt ending into a bleed,
     which reads as a mistake rather than as a graphic. A ribbon that leaves
     the frame has to be going somewhere; one that just stops has not earned
     the crop.

     So the whole form is now on the page. Only four shapes in the library are
     self-contained — loopA, loopB, coilA, coilB. The rest (sweeps, arches,
     rises, crests, drift, and the hooks) are authored to bleed: their paths
     run past the viewBox on purpose, which is right for a band that spans a
     hero and wrong for a deliberate object. They stay in the library, unused
     here.

     Placement is computed from each shape's own INK bounds rather than from
     its box, so the drawn form sits EDGE% from the page edge whatever its
     size — the box is mostly empty space and anchoring by it put the ink in a
     different place for every shape.

     These sit BEHIND the content (.lineset is z-index 0, everything else 1),
     so they can pass under copy without blocking it. */
  /* ONE OPACITY for every ribbon, not a ramp by rank. These used to run
     .40 / .22 / .16, which greyed the colour and muted the shading the tube

     three rungs already do that. Full strength then proved too loud against

       FOUR PER SET, and the count is not arbitrary — each entry has a job:

            Dropped on a band under 620px, where it would lie across the copy.
         2. two GUTTER RUNNERS, one per edge. These bleed top and bottom, so
            they run down the margins and out of the band at both ends. They
            are what carries a shallow pagehead — the section does not have to
            be tall enough to hold them.
         3. a complete FORM, tucked into a corner, as the punctuation.
       A short band therefore still draws three, along both gutters, rather
       than one mark alone in a lot of space.

       Hue is NAMED and always one of the four; it picks that stroke's own
